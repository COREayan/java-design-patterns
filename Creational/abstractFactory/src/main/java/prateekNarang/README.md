**Abstract Factory Pattern**
- Consider an application that needs to support multiple UI themes(e.g., Windows, macOS). Each theme has its own set of UI componenets such as buttons, scrollbars, and windows. The challenge is to create an architecture that allows switching between these themes without changing the client code that uses the UI components.
- Without the Abstract Factory Pattern, the client code would be tightly coupled with the concrete impelementations of buttons, scrollbars, etc., and switching between themes would require modifying the client code.

**Problems in Code**
- **Tight Coupling:** The client code is tightly coupled to specific implementations of UI componenets(WindowsButton, WindowsScrollBar).
- **Hard to extend:** If we want to add support for macOS UI components, we would need to modify the client code to create instances of MacOSButton and MacOSScrollBar.

**Problem It Solves:** Provides an interface for creating **families of related objects** without specifying their concrete classes.

**Structure:** 
- **Abstract Factory:** Interface for creating abstract products.
- **Concrete Factory:** Implements the abstract factory and creates concrete products.

Using the Abstract Factory Pattern, you create interfaces for each product (e.g., Button, ScrollBar, Window) and provide a family of concrete implementations for each theme (e.g., WindowsButton, MacOSButton, etc.). The Abstract Factory provides a way to create a suite of related objects without knowing the exact type of objects that will be created.
