**Decorator Pattern**
- You need to add functionaility to an object at runtime, but subclassing would lead to an explosion of subclasses or is impractical.
- Let's say we have a simple Pizza ordering system. Initially, we just have plain pizza but now we want to add options such as cheese, olives, tomatoes and mushrooms without modifying the existing pizza class or creating multiple subclasses.
- Let's use the **Decorator Pattern** using a Pizza making example where different toppings(like cheese, olives, tomatoes, etc.) can be dynamically added to the base pizza.
