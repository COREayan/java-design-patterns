**Command Pattern**

**Motivation**
- Imagine you're developing a basic text editor with buttons for **bold, italic,** and **underline** text formatting.
- Without the Command Pattern, the buttons directly interact with the TextEditor class, and you'd end up hardcoding behavior into the UI classes, making them tightly coupled.

**Problems in Code**
- Each button class is tightly coupled with the TextEditor. If the action changes, all button classes need to be modified.
- It's harder to extend with new commands or add functionality such as undo/redo or logging.

Command Pattern 
- By introducing the Command Pattern, we can decouple the actions(bold, italic, underline) from the UI components(buttons), making the design more flexible and maintainable. The buttons no longer need to know about the editor directly but instead work with generic Command objects.

**Command Pattern Structure**

Structure
- **Command:** Interface for executing operations.
- **Invoker:** Sends the command.
- **Receiver:** Performs the operation.

**Command Pattern Benefits**
- **Decoupling of Invoker and Receiver:** The button(invoker) doesn't know the details of the TextEditor(receiver), making the system more flexible and reusable.
- **Command History and Undo:** Commands can be logged for undo/redo functionality.
- **Task Queuing:** Commands can be stored in a queue and executed later, making it useful for task scheduling. 
- **Extensibility:** New commands can be added easily without modifying exisiting code. For example, adding a ChangeColorCommand only requires creating a new command class.

**Command Pattern Use Cases**

**GUI Applications:**
- Commands can be associated with buttons, menus, and keyboard shortcuts in applications like text editors, spreadsheets, or drawing software.

**Task Scheduling:**
- Commands can be placed in a queue and executed later, useful in batch processing or deferred task execution.

**Undo/Redo Functionality:**
- Commands can be stored and rolled back to provide undo and redo capabilites, especially in applications like IDEs, word processors, or graphics software.

**Macro Recording:**
- Actions performed by the user can be recorded as a series of commands, which can then be played back as macros.
